# TGT_Barcode_Counter
Tension Gauge Tether (TGT) barcode internalization counter for a sequencing-based method by which to characterize cellular tension profiles.

This script takes in forward and reverse reads and searches them for predefined barcode sequences, counts them, combines the paired-end reads, and exports a .txt file. We have included the raw NGS data and source code here.
